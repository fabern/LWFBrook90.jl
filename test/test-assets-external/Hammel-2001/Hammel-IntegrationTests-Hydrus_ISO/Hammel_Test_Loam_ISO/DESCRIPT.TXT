Hammel et al. 2001 infiltration simulation in Loam
- On day 1 100mm of rain is applied and infiltrates into a soil
- Initial conditions of soil were at θ = 0.16
- Isotope: rain has δ=-20 permil -> δ_shifted = δ+120 = 100 permil
- Isotope: IC of soil is δ=-100.5 permil -> δ_shifted = δ+120 = 20.5 permil
